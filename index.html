                <h2>Cognitive Stimulation</h2>
                <p>Reading engages your mind in ways that few other activities can. When you immerse yourself in a book, you must visualize characters, settings, and events. This mental exercise stimulates your brain, improving memory, concentration, and critical thinking skills. It's like a workout for your mind, keeping it sharp and agile.
